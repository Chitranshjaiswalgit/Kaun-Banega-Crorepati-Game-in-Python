# Kaun-Banega-Crorepati-Game-in-Python

This Python script emulates the popular game "Kaun Banega Crorepati" (Who Wants to Be a Millionaire), allowing players to answer a series of multiple-choice questions to win cash prizes. The game includes a list of questions, each associated with a monetary value, and the user has the opportunity to quit at any point to secure their accumulated winnings.

The script begins by displaying a welcoming message and introducing the rules of the game. It then iterates through the list of questions, presenting each question along with the corresponding options. Users are prompted to input their answer choice (1, 2, 3, or 4) or 0 to quit. The game evaluates the correctness of the answer and progresses accordingly.

The player's winnings increase with each correct answer, and specific milestones are set at questions 5, 10, and 15, offering higher prize amounts. If the player chooses to quit or provides an incorrect answer, the game ends, and the accumulated winnings are displayed. The script concludes with a thank-you message for playing "Kaun Banega Crorepati."

Overall, the code implements an interactive quiz game that simulates the excitement and challenge of the iconic TV show. Players have the chance to test their knowledge and potentially win a virtual cash prize.
