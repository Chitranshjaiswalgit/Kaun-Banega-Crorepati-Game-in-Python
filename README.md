## Project Overview
This Python script simulates the popular game 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' where players answer a series of multiple-choice questions to earn cash prizes. Players have the option to quit the game at any point and keep the accumulated winnings. Each question is associated with a specific amount of money, representing the potential prize for a correct answer. The script begins by welcoming the player with an introductory message outlining the game rules and expectations. It then sequentially presents each question along with the answer options (numbered 1 to 4). Players input their answer choice, with the option to quit the game by entering '0'.

The game evaluates the correctness of the answers:
- If the answer is correct, the player earns the corresponding prize money. There are predefined milestones (every 5th, 10th, and 15th correct answer) where the prize amount increases.
- If the answer is incorrect, the game ends, and the accumulated winnings up to that point are displayed.

The script concludes by thanking the player for participating in the 'Kaun Banega Crorepati' game.
